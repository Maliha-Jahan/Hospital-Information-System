This is a Hospital Information System implemented using Prolog. It interacts with the user and can do the following things:
1. Recommends hospitals based on the nature of your emergency and your current area.
2. Shows a list of hospitals in your area and creates appointment with a doctor of any of those hospitals
3. Shows the number of available cabins or ward beds of a hospital.
